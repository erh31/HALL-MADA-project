RUNNING THE CODE:

In order to process the raw data run DataCleaning.R, following the steps outlined in DataCleaning.html.

*** NOTE: DataCleaning.R will take ~30 minutes to run! This is because it has to grab information using the SpotifyAPI in three separate spots. There are loading bars to mark progress but it will take a while.
