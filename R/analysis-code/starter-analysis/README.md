This folder contains code to do some simple starter analysis on the processed/cleaned data.
The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the `results` folder.

* First, there is an R script that you can run which does all the computations.
* Second, there is a Quarto file which contains exactly the same code as the R script.

Follow the instructions in the R Code/Quarto.
